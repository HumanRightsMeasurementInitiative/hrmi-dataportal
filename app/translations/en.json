  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.methodologyUncertainty": "For more information please see our methodology handbook",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.methodologyUncertaintyURL": "https://humanrightsmeasurement.org/methodology-handbook",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.uncertaintyLong": "The more detailed answer is that when we calculate our civil and political rights scores, the results could theoretically take on any value. Because there are not real limits on the scores that come out of our model, we sometimes end up with uncertainty bands that range beyond 10 or below 0. We still present those bands completely – and don’t just cut them off at 0 or 10 – to accurately show our level of certainty in the country's score.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.scale": "Why are the two types of metrics not on the same scale?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.scale": "HRMI metrics use two different methodologies that have different scales and interpretations. \n\nThe scores for the economic and social rights metrics are percentage scores. Their interpretation depends on the benchmark used. When using the income adjusted benchmark, the scores tell you how well the country is doing compared to what should be feasible for a country with that income level. In other words, it tells you the extent to which the country is meeting its immediate obligation in international law to fulfil the right “to the maximum of its available resources.” This is not the same as the extent to which people in the country enjoy the right. \n\nWhen using the global best benchmark (accessed by clicking 'Switch view'), the scores tell you how well the country is doing compared to the best performing countries at any income level. Achieving the global best benchmark is consistent with meeting its full obligation to fulfill the right aspect concerned. \n\nBy contrast, the scores for the civil and political rights metrics are a score out of 10, indicating the extent to which the government in the country respected that right (10 is the best a country can do). These scores are produced using an expert survey methodology.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.year": "Why are the two sets of metrics not for the same year?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.year": "All metrics presented are the most recent data available. \n\n The economic and social rights metrics draw on data from international databases, so the most recent available data are usually from a few years ago. These scores are from the 2020 update of the International Social and Economic Rights Fulfilment (SERF) Index, which covers the period from 2007 to 2017. The data used for each year are the most recently available data as of that year. HRMI graphs use the most recently available data from the full dataset. \n\n Where shown, the civil and political rights metrics are for the calendar year 2019. Comparisons with earlier years are also available under the Safety from the State and Empowerment tabs.",

  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.indicators": "Why aren’t the same indicators used for all countries?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.indicators": "This is because the same data are not always collected for all countries in the world. The low and middle income assessment standard uses indicators that are widely available for and relevant to low and middle income countries.  The high income assessment standard uses some indicators that are widely available for high income countries (but not low and middle income countries) and better reflect the economic and social right challenges faced by high income countries. However, all countries are evaluated using both sets of indicators to the extent data are available.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.measureIndicators": "How does the HRMI methodology calculate the {metricLower} score from raw data?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureIndicators": "All HRMI measures of economic and social rights have been produced using official statistics collected by national governments and harmonised by international organisations. For each indicator, our methodology compares the observed level of enjoyment of that dimension of human rights to the benchmark level. \n\n In the case of the **income adjusted benchmark**, the country’s enjoyment level is compared to the enjoyment level that other countries have shown can be achieved at that per-capita income level. This means that HRMI’s income adjusted economic and social rights metrics can show how well a government is using its available resources to ensure that people enjoy these rights to the maximum extent possible. \n\n In the case of the **global best benchmark**, the country’s enjoyment level is compared to the highest enjoyment level of countries at any per capita income level.",

  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightESRNotesOne": "HRMI scores measure how well governments use their resources for good rights outcomes, not the number of people who are enjoying their rights. A score of 100% does NOT imply that everyone in the country enjoys the right. Rather, it tells us that the country is doing as well as any other country has done at the same per-capita income level.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightESRNotesTwo": "A score of 100% does NOT mean there is no room for improvement. Countries with high HRMI scores are still obliged under international law to keep improving. These countries may need to innovate to deepen and extend human rights enjoyment further than has been done in the past.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightESRNotesThree": "HRMI scores are based on statistics across whole country populations. If a high income country earns a high HRMI score on a right, there might still be population subgroups (like women or indigenous people) in that country who do not enjoy the right equally. \n\n HRMI uses the SERF Index methodology to produce these scores. Visit the SERF Index website.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.measureRightCPR": "How does HRMI measure {metricLower}?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightCPR": "We measure all civil and political rights using a survey of in-country human rights experts. We ask questions about the frequency of violations of each right, then combine the answers with a statistical model that means we can compare responses across countries, and over time. \n\n We then show the results as an estimated score out of 10, within an uncertainty band. \n\n We also ask the in-country experts about who is at particular risk of human rights abuses. We show information based on their responses on the 'People at risk' tab on the country pages.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.measureDimensionESR": "How does HRMI measure {metricLower}?",

  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.grades": "The labels on the graphs of good, fair, bad, and very bad are used here to give a general indication of how to understand the scores. They are NOT comprehensive descriptions of a country’s performance on an individual right.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.where": "Where do HRMI's scores come from?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.where.both": "We use two different methodologies.\n\n To measure <b>Quality of Life</b> – economic and social rights – we start with data from international databases. Then we use econometric techniques to combine the data with each country’s level of income, to produce a score. The score, expressed as a percentage, shows how well a country is using its resources to produce good human rights outcomes. Every country should be able to get near its 100% income-adjusted target by improving policies and practices, even without more money.\n\n To measure <b>Safety from the State</b> and <b>Empowerment</b> rights – civil and political rights – we do our own research, using an expert survey methodology. In a secure, anonymous, online questionnaire, we ask local human rights experts (such as people working for human rights organisations; human rights lawyers; journalists specialising in social issues) a series of detailed questions about government behaviour in the previous year. We use Bayesian statistical techniques to produce a score out of ten, displayed within an uncertainty band that shows the range of scores we calculate as most likely to represent the real situation in that country.",

  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.how": "How does HRMI define these rights?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.how": "We base all our measurements on the definitions of human rights contained in international law.\n\n When you are looking at a country’s scores, you can click on the name of each right on the graph and see the definition, and the legal source.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.difference": "What is the difference between HRMI scores and indicator values?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.difference": "The indicator values are about people's experiences in each country. The HRMI scores are about how well each government is meeting its human rights obligations.\n\n Our methodology starts with <b>indicator values</b>, which show what percentage of people in a country meet the indicator definition. Then we turn those indicator values into <b>HRMI scores</b> which show how well a country's government is doing at making sure its people enjoy their rights, given what should be possible at its level of income.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.why": "Why does HRMI use these indicators to measure these rights?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.why": "For each economic and social right, the SERF Index methodology, which HRMI uses, selects a small number of high-level ‘bellwether’ indicators to give an overview of people’s experiences in each country. The scores produced can be tracked and compared over time, and across countries.\n\n The choice of indicators is also influenced by what data are available in international databases for enough countries in the world.
