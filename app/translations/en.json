  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.questions.measureDimensionCPR": "How has HRMI measured the {metric} score?",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.scale": "HRMI metrics use two different methodologies that have different scales and interpretations. The scores for the civil and political rights metrics are a score out of 10 indicating the extent to which the government in the country respected that right. By contrast, the scores for the economic and social rights metrics are percentage scores. Their interpretation depends on the benchmark used. When using the income-adjusted benchmark, the scores tell you the percentage level of enjoyment achieved on that right relative to what should be feasible for a country with that income level. In other words, it tells you the extent to which the country is meeting its immediate obligation to fulfil the right “to the maximum of its available resources.” This is not the same as the extent to which people in the country enjoy the right. When using the global best benchmark, the scores tell you the percentage level of enjoyment achieved on that right relative to the highest score attained by the best performing countries at any income level. Achieving the global best benchmark is consistent with meeting its full obligation to fulfill the right aspect concerned.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.year": "All metrics presented are the most recent data available. The civil and political rights metrics are for calendar years 2017 and 2018. The economic and social rights metrics are from the 2019 update of the International Social and Economic Rights Fulfilment Index, which covers the period from 2006 to 2016. The data used for each year are the most recently available data as of that year. HRMI graphs use the most recently available data from the full dataset.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.indicators": "This is because the same data are not always collected for all countries in the world. The low and middle income assessment standard uses indicators that are widely available for and relevant to low and middle income countries.  The high income assessment standard uses some indicators that are widely available for high income countries (but not low and middle income countries) and better reflect the economic and social right challenges faced by high income countries. However, all countries are evaluated using both sets of indicators to the extent data are available.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureIndicators": "All HRMI measures of economic and social rights have been produced using official statistics collected by national governments and harmonised by international organisations. For each indicator, our methodology compares the observed level of enjoyment of that dimension of human rights to the enjoyment level that other countries have shown can be achieved at that per-capita income level. HRMI economic and social rights metrics thus show how well the State is using its available resources to ensure that people enjoy these rights to the maximum extent possible.",

HRMI economic and social rights metrics thus show how well the State is using its available resources to ensure that people enjoy these rights to the maximum extent possible.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightESRNotesIntro": "Three things should be kept in mind when interpreting HRMI economic and social rights metrics",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightESRNotesOne": "A score of 100% does NOT imply that everyone in the country enjoys the right. Rather, it tells us that the country’s right enjoyment level is on par with the historically best-performing countries at the same per-capita income level.",
  "hrmi.containers.FAQs.answers.measureRightESRNotesTwo": "A score of 100% does NOT mean there is no room for improvement. Countries with high HRMI scores still need to innovate to deepen and extend human rights enjoyment further than has been done in the past.",

Their interpretations are sufficiently sound to be a base for building a simple model or for selecting and applying simple problem-solving strategies.  Students at this level can interpret and use representations based on different information sources and reason directly from them. They typically show some ability to handle percentages, fractions and decimal numbers, and to work with proportional relationships.  Their solutions reflect that they have engaged in basic interpretation and reasoning.",
  "hrmi.indicators-about.pisa-reading": "Percentage of students achieving level 3 or better on the PISA reading test.  Achievement levels run from 1 to 6. Tasks at this level [level 3] require the reader to locate, and in some cases recognize the relationship between, several pieces of information that must meet multiple conditions.  Interpretative tasks at this level require the reader to integrate several parts of a text in order to identify a main idea, understand a relationship or construe the meaning of a word or phrase.  They need to take into account many features in comparing, contrasting, or categorizing.",

  "hrmi.indicators-about.survival-65": "Percentage of people (gender) expected to survive to age 65.  GENDER SPECIFIC RATES: Survival to age 65 refers to the percentage of a cohort of newborn (gender) infants that would survive to age 65, if subject to cohort specific mortality rates for the gender of the specified year. TOTAL RATE estimated by weighting gender specific rates by the gender's fraction of newborns for that year.",
  "hrmi.indicators-about.under-5-survival": "Percentage of (gender) children surviving to age 5. FOR TOTAL: % children surviving to age 5 is 100 minus  (under-five mortality rate/10).  Under-five mortality rate is the probability per 1,000 that a newborn baby will die before reaching age five, if subject to age-specific mortality rates of the specified year. FOR GENDERS: % (gender) children surviving to age 5 is 100 minus the (gender under-five mortality rate/10). Under-five mortality rate is the probability per 1,000 that a newborn (gender) baby will die before reaching age five, if subject to gender age-specific mortality rates.",
  "hrmi.indicators-about.contraception": "The modern contraceptive prevalence rate. The modern contraceptive prevalence rate is the percentage of women who are practicing, or whose sexual partners are practicing, at least one modern method of contraception. It is usually measured for women ages 15-49 who are married or in union. Modern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, oral hormonal pills, the intra-uterine device (IUD), the male condom, injectables, the implant (including Norplant), vaginal barrier methods, the female condom and emergency contraception.",

  "hrmi.indicators-about.water-in-home": "Percentage of people with access to drinking from an improved source on premises.  Improved drinking water sources are those which, by nature of their design and construction, have the potential to deliver safe water. The JMP subdivides the population using improved sources into three groups according to the level of service provided. In order to meet the criteria for a safely managed drinking water service, people must use an improved source meeting three criteria: a)it should be accessible on premises, b)water should be available when needed, and c)the water supplied should be free from contamination. The % of people with water on premises is the percentage of people that are using improved sources that are accessible on premises.",
  "hrmi.indicators-about.basic-sanitation": "Percentage of people with access to basic sanitation.  Basic sanitation is defined as use of improved facilities which are not shared with other households. Improved sanitation facilities are those designed to hygienically separate excreta from human contact.",
