      'China is performing better than average in economic and social rights compared with other East Asian countries, according to our income-adjusted benchmark, though it still has significant challenges. We produce scores for China for the rights to food, health, housing and work.\n\nUnder the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, which China has signed, all countries agree to devote their maximum available resources to making things progressively better for their people in these areas.\n\nHRMI has calculated what China could be achieving at its current level of income. The scores are given as a percentage of that realistic potential achievement.\n\nChina’s best scores are for the **right to health**, where it is achieving 98.4 of what we calculate should be possible, and for the **right to food** (96.4%). For these rights, China is doing nearly as well as it possibly could, given its level of income. It could still afford to make some gains now, but then would need to increase its income to make further improvements.\n\nOf the four quality of life rights we measure, China needs to improve the most in the **right to housing**, where it is currently achieving only 87.2% of what we calculate should be possible at its level of income.\n\nWe further break the **right to housing** down into scores for the **right to sanitation** and the **right to water**.\n\nWith a GDP per capita of US$10,144 we calculate that China has the resources to ensure all of its people have running water and toilets in their homes. The good news is that China’s scores have been steadily improving since 2007, when the nation scored 74.5%.\n\nHowever, China’s **right to sanitation** score of 83.9% shows that many people are missing out, even though China could afford to do better. If China efficiently used its available resources, it could achieve a score of 100%, which would mean that over 129 million additional Chinese would gain access to basic sanitation in their homes.\n\n',

    defaultMessage:
      'When it comes to the **right to food**, if China lifted its score to 100%, over 2.5 million more children under five years old would have enough nutritious food to grow well – that would mean all children in China under five would have enough nutritious food to grow well. This is an achievable goal.\n\nWith a current score of 96.4%, China has improved only a little in respecting people’s **right to food** over the last 11 years.\n\nOn the **right to work**, China’s score has climbed up to 93.7% in 2019 from 62.2% in 2007, meaning many fewer people have been living in poverty over the last decade. Still, the latest score means 76 million Chinese are unnecessarily living in absolute poverty (living on less that $3.20 per day, measured in 2011 PPP$), and the government is only doing a ‘fair’ job at ensuring people have subsistence income.\n\nChina comes in second out of 143 low and middle income countries in ensuring people’s **right to health** is fulfilled, with a score of 98.4%, based on our low and middle income assessment standard. For countries doing this well with their current level of income, an increase of income will be necessary to make significant further improvements. This is the right where China is most constrained by resources – for all of the other rights we measure, China should already be able to do nearly as well as any country in the world, at its current level of income.',

      'While China has room for improvement in all the rights we measure, a further consideration is inequity. There are several groups of people who our experts identified as being at higher risk of missing out. These include:\n\n- People with lower social or economic status\n- People from ethnic minorities, including Tibetans, Uyghurs, Mongolians, and Kazakhs\n- Human rights advocates, protestors, and anyone who criticises the government\n- People living in rural areas, particularly older people, and women\n- Disabled people\n- Detainees\n- People from religious minorities, particularly those practising Falun Gong, Christianity, or Islam\n- Internally displaced people\n',

      'All our Quality of Life scores show that China could make significant improvements to its people’s lives, even without more resources.\n\nIf China were using its resources more efficiently to ensure its people’s wellbeing, it could achieve 100% for all the rights we measure. Yet, while its best score is close to that mark—98.4% on the right to health — its worst score — 87.2% on the right to housing — is far from that level.\n\nIf China better upheld its rights obligations, and achieved a full 100% score on all the rights we measure, we would see millions more Chinese people living lives of dignity, even without income growth. For example, if China reached 100% we would see the following number of extra people benefitting:\n- If China were to operate at its full potential given its current resources, we would expect an **additional 2.5 million children under five to grow well and not be stunted.**\n- If China were operating at best practice, each year we would expect **an extra 56,900 newborn babies to survive until their fifth birthday.**\n- If China were reaching its full potential, given its income constraints, **an extra 343,300 15-year-olds could eventually reach the age of 60.**\n- If China used its resources efficiently, **an additional 129 million people could have a toilet at home, and an extra 109 million people could have access to water in their homes.**\n- If China were operating at its full potential given its current resources, it could **lift 76 million people out of absolute poverty.**',
