      'China scores 2.8 out of 10 for our overall **Safety from the State** category, telling us that many people are at risk of arbitrary or political arrest or detention, torture and ill-treatment, forced disappearance, execution, or extrajudicial killing. This is one of the lowest scores in our sample of 31 countries. \n\nChinaâ€™s worst score in this category is 1 out of 10 for **freedom from the death penalty**, the lowest score among all the countries we measure.\n\nThe human rights experts we surveyed said that agents of the state, particularly police, had total impunity to engage in torture of those detained. \n\nRespondents overwhelmingly agreed that human rights advocates, protestors, and people who criticised the government were at particular risk of rights violations, especially arbitrary arrest and detention, forced disappearance, and torture and ill-treatment. \n\nSurvey respondents said that information about executions was deliberately obfuscated by the Chinese government, blurring the line between extrajudicial and judicial executions.\n\nPeople from ethnic minorities were at extra risk of all five Safety from the State rights. Respondents noted that Uyghur people, and other ethnic minorities, were commonly detained incommunicado in concentration camps. \n\nOther vulnerable groups include:\n- People from ethnic minorities, including Tibetans, Uyghurs, Mongolians, and Kazakhs\n- Human rights advocates, protestors, and anyone who criticises the government\n- Detainees and those accused of crimes\n- People from religious minorities, particularly those practising Falun Gong, Christianity, or Islam\n- Internally displaced people\n- People in Tibet, Xinjiang, and Hong Kong\n\nAmong other East Asian countries and territories where we measure these rights, China has the lowest scores for all five Safety from the State rights.',
