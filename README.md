# NOTES
- note that for PDF generation, currently you must have the font Source Sans Pro installed on your machine. This repo has the TrueType font under the 'fonts' folder - on Mac OS, just double-click the file to install it into your Font Book. In the future we need this font to be present to build the PDF's on cloud machines.
